(**********************************************************************)
(* version 4. Uses dynamic creation of new effect names to simulate
   the creation of new reference cells. Initially, there is only one
   effect 'New', which can be used to dynamically create new effect
   names. The handler for 'New' wraps the continuation in a new
   handler that handles the freshly generated effect names. This setup
   yields the same interface as ML refs, except that there is no way
   to compare references for equality. This is because cells are
   represeted as objects with a pair of a 'write' method and a 'read'
   method, so it is possible to create new references that reference
   the same underlying data without the access objects being
   equal. This is similar to the situation in Idealised Algol, where
   variables are ways to affect the state, but have no independent
   existence of their own.

   Compared to the example in "ref.ml", this implementation does not
   require a universal type, nor does it have "impossible" cases.

   This example also includes an unneccessary extra 'Choice' effect to
   demonstrate the combination of other effects with state in the same
   handler. This uses the experimental Obj.clone_continuation function to clone
   continuations. *)
